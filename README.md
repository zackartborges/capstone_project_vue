# OurPack Frontend

July 13, 2021 (Two months after graduating from Actualize Full Stack Bootcamp) -
This was one of my first personal where I personally created a web application from scratch, and is an example of my basic understanding of Vue.js as a framework. I will soon be working on restarting the front end to demonstrate how my knowledge has grown since graduating from the boot camp.

-----
This is a simple CRUD application that allows backpackers/hikers to
track the gear they plan on bringing on adventures. The gear can be separated into categories, and uses a
responsive graph that adjusts depending on the weight of each item, as well as the total pack weight.
